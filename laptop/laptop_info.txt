Getting Started:

    Laptop Username: RSL
    Laptop Password: rsl
    Path: ~/Desktop/moana/MOANA2.0

    Moana Username: moana
    Moana Password: root
    Path: ~/MOANA2.0

Things You Need:
    1) MOANA - You need moana to test moana
    2) Control Laptop - You need laptop to test with laptop
    3) Self - Need self for self to do testing
    4) Internet connection - Need to share connection between laptop and moana


Connecting to MOANA:
    1) On control laptop, go into network and internet settings
    2) Make sure the laptop is connected to the internet
    3) Under mobile hotspot, turn on mobile hotspot
    4) Wait for moana to connect.
        i) moana should auto connect
        ii) you will know that it was successful when the connected devices changes from 0/8 to 1/8
        iii) additionally moana will be listed among the connected devices with it's ip address
        iv) note: the ip-address will be needed later

        Congratulations! You are now connected to MOANA!

Running Tests on Command Line:
    1) Open command prompt
    2) Enter: ssh moana@ip-address
        ii) ip-address should be replaced with the ip address from step 4 of the previous section
    3) When prompted for a password enter: root
    4) Enter: cd MOANA2.0/jetson
        i) This will move you into the jetson directory of moana

    Simple tests:
        1) Refer to documentation listed in "info.txt" located in the MOANA2.0/jetson directory

    In-Depth Tests:
        1) Enter: python3
            i) this will open a python3 shell
            ii) start of line will be: >>>
        2) Determine system to test: SystemControl, PitchControl, RudderControl, CANBUS_COMMS
            i) For SystemControl enter: 
                a) from systemControl import SystemControl
                b) ob = SystemControl()
            ii) For PitchControl enter:
                a) from pitch import PitchControl
                b) ob = PitchControl()
            iii) For RudderControl enter:
                a) from rudder import RudderControl
                b) ob = RudderControl()
            iv) For CANBUS_COMMS enter:
                a) from canbus_comms import CANBUS_COMMS
                b) ob = CANBUS_COMMS()
        3) Run commands by entering: ob.command()
            i) command() should be replaced with a some real command, can tab to auto-complete or show commands

Running Tests With GUI:
    1) Open command prompt
    2) Enter: cd Desktop/MOANA2.0/laptop
        i) This will move you into the laptop directory of moana
    3) Enter: python3 gui.py
        i) This should open the gui
        ii) Make sure to keep command prompt window open, or it will close GUI
        iii) If expecting an output, it can be viewed in command prompt window
