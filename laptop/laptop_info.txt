    Moana Username: moana
    Moana Password: root
    Path: ~/MOANA2.0

Things You Need:
    1) MOANA - You need moana to test moana
    2) Control Laptop - You need laptop to test with laptop
    3) Self - Need self for self to do testing
    4) Buddy - Naughty naughty, its not safe to be testing alone
    4) Internet connection - Need to share connection between laptop and moana


Connecting to MOANA:
    1) On control laptop, go into network and internet settings
    2) Make sure the laptop is connected to the internet
    3) Under mobile hotspot, turn on mobile hotspot
    4) Wait for moana to connect.
        i) moana should auto connect
        ii) you will know that it was successful when the connected devices changes from 0/8 to 1/8
        iii) additionally moana will be listed among the connected devices alongside it's ip address
        iv) note: the ip-address will be needed later

    Congratulations! You are now connected to MOANA!

Testing:
    * 4 Ways to Run Tests: GUI, CLI, guirecieve, and python3 shell

    1) GUI: MOANA GUI
        * Easiest way to test
        Steps:
            1) On control laptop open command prompt
            2) cd Desktop/moana/MOANA2.0/laptop
            3) python3 gui.py

    2) CLI: MOANA CLI
        * Most reliable way to test
        * Adapted from 2021 moana senior design project
        Steps:
            1) On control laptop open command prompt
            2) ssh moana@ip-address
            3) Password: root
            4) cd MOANA2.0/jetson
            5) python3 comms.py

    3) guirecieve
        * Additional documentation can be found in MOANA2.0/jetson/jetson_info.txt
        * Class was designed to handle incoming messages from MOANA GUI
        Steps:
            1) On control laptop open command prompt
            2) ssh moana@ip-address
            3) Password: root
            4) cd MOANA2.0/jetson
            5) python3 guirecieve.py [command] {args}

    4) python3 shell
        * No additonal documentation available
        * Should only be used as last resort
        * Only use if you know what you are doing
        * Alternative imports (WARNING: COULD CAUSE ISSUES IF USED INCORRECTLY): 
            * from pitch import PitchControl
            * from rudder import RudderControl
            * from thrust import ThrustControl
            * from canbus_comms import CANBUS_COMMS
        Steps:
            1) On control laptop open command prompt
            2) ssh moana@ip-address
            3) Password: root
            4) cd MOANA2.0/jetson
            5) python3
            6) from systemControl import SystemControl
            7) sc = SystemControl()
            8) sc.someCommand({params})
                i) No available documentation on usable commands
                ii) You may refer to SystemControl class to see available function calls
                ii) Example: sc.setStepper(10)
